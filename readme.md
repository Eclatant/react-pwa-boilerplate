## WARNING

This project is still in the incubation and not optimized fully yet. And many of features and codes could be significantly changed.

## Goals

- Build Modern Progressive Web App in strong background of performance
	- Web Manifest
	- Service Worker
	- Application Shell Architecture (with React MDL)
	- Supporting PRPL pattern
- Highlighted with cutting-edge technologies like React.js latest version, Webpack 2, Babel with ES2015 latest version and more latest concepts and tools

## Look and feel

By following material design and App shell design guide, We decide to mostly keep same design concept as [Polymer Starter Kit](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit) via [react-mdl](https://react-mdl.github.io)

### Theme

You can change a primary color and accent color to customize theme of layouts using css generated by [Custom CSS theme builder](https://getmdl.io/customize/index.html) at [getmdl.id](https://getmdl.io). Currently, we named its `material.grey-deep_orange.min.css` as `src/theme.css`

## Install

Currently, we use yarn mainly not npm but you can be allowed to use npm

```js
yarn install
```

### Run

Test with Webpack Dev Server and also you can test with server worker on the server if you set `true` to `webpackDevServerConfig.serviceWorker` in `scripts/config.js`

```
// dev server start without service worker
yarn start

// dev server start with service worker
yarn start -- --sw
```

### Build

This application will be built taking advanges from [xo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo), eslint, [Webpack2](https://webpack.js.org/)

```
yarn run build
```

### Test

We are mainly using [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) and [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) to test our React components. Please visit to each sites for understanding how to use it. /cc [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom)

```
yarn test
```
